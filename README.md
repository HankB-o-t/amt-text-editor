# AmT (A microsocopic TextEditor)
AmT ( A microsocopic TextEditor ) is a very very tiny text-editor with modes and other things

## If the project don't work or has errors, do the following:
- ReCompile

## Requeriments (for the best experience)
- Compiler: MinGW with default libraries
- Windows 10
- VsCode for development (or another editor if you want)

### If you use Visual Studio Code:
- Get the C/C++ Extension
- Press F1 and put `Enable Error Squiggles` to enable the error highlighting
- And if that don't work, go to the C/C++ extension settings and enable that from there
